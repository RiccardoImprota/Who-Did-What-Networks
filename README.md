# Who-did-What Networks

<p align="center">

</p>

A Python library that implements a novel framework to measure bias through its actors, actions and consequences in English.


## Description
Who-Did-What cognitive networks are a novel framework to measure bias through its actors, actions and consequences. These semantic/syntactic multilayer networks are composed of 3 layers:
- subjects/actors (WHO)
- objects/actions (DID)
- verbs/consequences (WHAT)

Part-of-speech tagging is determined by an AI reading each sentence in a text (spaCy). Inter-layer connections are established with a rule-based approach applied on the syntactic parsing of an AI (spaCy). Intra-layer connections are semantic and established only if two words are synonyms (e.g. father and dad), highlighted in green. Like in textual forma mentis networks (Stella, PeerJ Comp. Sci, 2020), individual concepts are labelled as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù (cyan), ‚Äúnegative‚Äù (red) and ‚Äúneutral‚Äù (gray) according to Vader Sentiment Analysis. Inter-layer paths indicate ‚Äúwho did what‚Äù - i.e. which actions and which consequences were portrayed by specific agents in texts. Whereas tools such through EmoAtlas can give general results about the overall context of biased perceptions, Who-Did-What networks can complement TFMNs by providing a focus on actors, actions and consequences.

This framework only works for the English language.

### Features

- **SVO Extraction**: Extracts subjects (who), verbs(did), and objects(what) from sentences.
- **Coreference Resolution**: Handles pronouns and other references using either `stanza` or `fastcoref`.
- **Valence Analysis**: Determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of words using Vader.
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualizes SVO relationships using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
- **Hypergraphs extraction**: handles the exporting of the who-did-what relationships as a pandas dataframe.
- **Semantic enrichment**: Synonyms are included in the SVO extraction and in the visualization.
